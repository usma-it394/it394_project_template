# it394_project_template
A project template for a Python/Django project ready to deploy into the Heroku production environment.

# How to use this template
Start your DAD virtual environment.
```
& $Env:WORKON_HOME\DAD\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
Change to your project directory
```
cd $Env:PROJECT_HOME\DAD
```

To use this template start a new project using django-admin and the --template parameter
```
django-admin startproject --template=http://github.com/usma-it394/it394_project_template/archive/master.zip <project name>
```

You should use an all lower case name (with no special characters) for your project name.

django-admin startproject will correctly rename the project_name folder and also replace the {{ }} patterns with the correct values for the contents of the files in the project_name folder.

Unfortunately, it does not apply changes to the contents of files in the root directory of the project.  I've included a simple PowerShell script named "fix_name.ps1" that will replace the {{ project_name }} pattern in any files in the current working directory.  So after you start the project run
```
cd <project name>
.\fix_name.ps1 -name "project name"
```

For example, if I wanted to start a new project named "nifty" I would enter the following:
```
django-admin startproject --template=http://github.com/usma-it394/it394_project_template/archive/master.zip nifty
cd nifty
.\fix_name.ps1 -name "nifty"
```

# Install packages required by Heroku
Install the packages from requirements.txt (you probably already have these installed in your DAD environment):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Local data management commands

Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable. Then create the initial database structure and create the initial security principal with:
```
python manage.py syncdb
```

See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/django-admin/#syncdb


#Deploy into production
After you have cloned this repository you can deploy it to heroku.  First you'll need to login to your heroku account with:
```
heroku login
```
Then tell heroku to create a new application with:
```
heroku create
```
The "heroku create" command will add a new remote to your local git repo.  You can see it with:
```
git remote -v
```
Now you can push the local repo to heroku.  This is how you "deploy your project into the production environment on Heroku".
```
git push heroku master
```
You can observe the status of the application on heroku with
```
heroku logs
heroku ps
```

# Remote data management commands
We are separated from Heroku by a firewall that blocks interactive access to Heroku one-off dynos (See: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos).  Because of this you'll need to interact with Heroku using the run:detached option.


Create the database structure with
```
heroku run:detached python manage.py migrate
```

The firewall configuration also complicates the creation of the projects initial security principal (the "superuser"). Check the file named create_admin.sh.  It provides a method to create the superuser on heroku.

```
heroku run:detached bash ./create_admin.sh admin admin@example.com password
```

# Misc

## Reuse a Heroku Application Instance
Instead of creating a new Heroku application with "heroku create", You can associate a new clone of a project with an existing Heroku application instance.  I could clone this repository then associate it with the heroku application "immense-scrubland-9864" (previosly made with "heroku create" on another computer) with the following command:
```
heroku git:remote â€“a immense-scrubland-9864
```

## Procfile
Heroku uses the commands in the Procfile to run your application.  See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile for additional information.
